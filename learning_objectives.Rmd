# Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

The goal of this course is for you to gain confidence in carrying out the entire data science pipeline, 

from research question formulation, 
to data collection/scraping,
to wrangling, 
to modeling, 
to visualization, 
to presentation and communication


Specific course topics and general skills are listed below.

## General Skills {.unnumbered}

**Data Communication**

-   In written and oral formats:

    -   Inform and justify data cleaning and analysis process and the resulting conclusions with clear, organized, logical, and compelling details that adapt to the background, values, and motivations of the audience and context in which communication occurs.
